# AWS CodeCommit Update

## 🚨 AWS CodeCommit No Longer Available for New Customers! 🚨

While exploring **AWS CodeCommit**, I tried to create a demo repository but ran into this error:

❌ **"CreateRepository request is not allowed because there is no existing repository in this AWS account or AWS Organization."**

At first, I thought it was a permissions issue, but then I realized the bigger picture…

### **AWS CodeCommit is no longer available to new customers!**
Existing users can continue using it, but no new features are planned.

### **Official AWS Announcement:**

> *"After careful consideration, we have made the decision to close new customer access to AWS CodeCommit, effective July 25, 2024. AWS CodeCommit existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. AWS continues to invest in security, availability, and performance improvements for AWS CodeCommit, but we do not plan to introduce new features."*

## **What’s Next?**

- 🚀 If you're looking for alternatives, AWS **CodeCatalyst**, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are great options.
- 🛠️ Existing AWS CodeCommit users can keep using it, but should consider future migration plans.
